# Birth Center vs Hospital Cost Comparison

## Description
This project compares the costs and outcomes of childbirth between birth centers and hospitals. It evaluates key metrics like:
- Total cost of childbirth
- Recovery time
- Readmission rates

## Tools Used:
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib)
- Excel (optional for financial breakdown)
- Data visualization tools (e.g., Tableau)

## Data Sources:
- Data sourced from Kaggle/WHO/CDC

## Key Findings:
- Birth centers tend to have lower overall costs for vaginal births.
- Hospitals generally show higher costs, especially for C-sections.
- Recovery time and readmission rates are impacted by setting choice.

## Future Work:
- Include more detailed cost breakdown by insurance type.
- Analyze long-term health outcomes associated with each setting.
